The top level things about writing with markdown, serving with Jekyll, and publishing with github page.

[toc]

## Cold startup

In the root directory, it is necessary to create the [./docs]() directory to start the project from the ground.
Since the github page supports the page in the [./docs]().
The [./init-jekyll-site.ps1]() script will create the directory, after that the following is required: [^jekyll]

- Edit the [./docs/\_config.yml]() file for jekyll configuration.
- Edit the [./docs/Gemfile]() file for ruby configuration.
- Change directory (cd) to the [./docs]().
- Run `bundle install` to install the ruby.
- Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace` to start the jekyll serve
- BTW, I have put my default configuration files into the [./default]() directory.

## Warm startup

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace` to start the jekyll serve.
The documents are in the [\_posts]() directory (see **Markdown document** for detail).
The script will automatically update the [\_site]() directory, where the static files are placed.

It should be noticed that the script has to be restarted if you have the [\_config.yml]() or [Gemfile]() file changed, or the changing will not be applied.

## Markdown document

The .md or .markdown files inside the [\_posts]() directory are the documents.
It is no matter how depth they are, but what really matter is their names.
The good names are in the format of

> YYYY-MM-DD-document-title.md

Only the regular file name is supported by the Jekyll.

### Front matter

The document's compile header is also required by the Jekyll.
For example, the header of the document is like this:

```md
<!-- Example of YML compile header (front matter) -->

```

It translates the variables to the Jekyll when compiling into .html files.
The dashes wraps the header content and the paragraph following is the **excerpt**.
The `layout` variable controls which `_layout` template is used by the MinimalMistakes [^minimal-mistakes] to render the document.

## Features linking md and html

The Jekyll render the .md files into .html static files.
Precisely, the .md files in [\_posts]() is rendered into .html files in [\_site]() by the Jekyll.
During the process, the MinimalMistakes controls the output theme.
Moreover, it requires .md file, Jekyll and MinimalMistakes configures to make the features work well.

BTW, the MinimalMistakes is installed in the directory like [gem/ruby/3.3.0/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-4.26.2]() in my case.

### Table of contents

The toc feature supporting is configured in the [\_config.yml]() file

```yml
# Use jekyll-toc plugin
plugins:
  - jekyll-toc
```

It also requires the compile header declaration in the .md file, to use the toc on the page.

```yml
# The toc option

# YML front matter: Put the toc on the page
# It is specified to the document.
toc: true

# It also works on the _config.yml file as the default option
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      share: true
      related: true
      mathjax: true
      toc: true
      toc_sticky: true
      toc_label: "Table of contents"
      toc_icon: "bars" # corresponding Font Awesome icon name (without fa prefix)
      breadcrumbs: true # disabled by default
```

The icons can be found in the fontawesome. [^fontawesome-icons]

![toc-example](/assets/toc-example.png "toc-example")

### Author profile

The `author_profile: true` option adds the author profile as the left sidebar.
It requires the [\_data/authors.yml]() contains the author information. [^author-profile]

```yml
listenzcc:
  name: listenzcc
  avatar: "/assets/profile/bio-photo.jpg"
  bio: "I am a programmer."
  location: "Somewhere"
  links:
    - label: "GitHub"
      icon: "fab fa-fw fa-github"
      url: "https://github.com/listenzcc"
    - label: "Made Mistakes"
      icon: "fas fa-fw fa-link"
      url: "https://mademistakes.com"
```

### Image url

The image asset is an issue to support not only editing but also publishing.
Specifically, the image in the .md file is like

```html
<!-- The difference between .md and .html file -->

<!--
Image block in the .md file
The assets/ folder is on the root path of the project
-->
![toc-example](/assets/toc-example.png "toc-example")

<!--
Image tag in the .html file
The site's url is http://127.0.0.1:4000
The site's baseurl is '/book'
-->
<img
  src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/book/assets/toc-example.png"
  alt="toc-example"
  title="toc-example"
  style="border: solid red;"
/>
```

It turns that the .html file needs its image under `baseurl` [^base-url] but the .md file preview doesn't need it.
As a result, the `baseurl` should be automatically added to the `img.src` when rendering.

I haven't find decent way to do that, so I override the [\_includes/after-content.html]() file.
It is the javascript script doing the converting job after the `content` is loaded.
The solution is specific to the MinimalMistakes, since it uses the [\_includes/after-content.html]().
BTW, to make the image looks better, I also border it with red color.

| Site variable | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| url           | A siteâ€™s full URL including protocol, domain, and port (if applicable). |
| baseurl       | Name of sub-directory the site is served from e.g., /blog.              |

![url-example](/assets/url-example.jpg "url-example")

### Code syntax

The code block detecting and syntax highlighting is configured in the [\_config.yml]() file.
It also toggles whether to display the button of copy code.

```yml
# Code syntax configuration
# rouge highlighter support
highlighter: rouge

# Display copy code button
enable_copy_code_button: true

# syntax highlight
kramdown:
  input: GFM
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
  syntax_highlighter_opts:
    css_class: highlight
    default_lang: console
    span:
      line_numbers: false
    block:
      line_numbers: true
      start_line: 1
```

### Equations

Take the equation for example

$$ \tag{1.1} e^{j \pi} + 1 = 0 $$

Add the math js script to the .html file makes it work, it also requires the `markdown: kramdown` in the [\_config.yml]().

Also, the jekyll-spaceship[^jekyll-spaceship] solves the inline equation with `$\alpha$` syntax, it gives $\alpha$.
It requires the following setup

```yml
# Install jekyll-spaceship

# Install the gem in Gemfile
gem 'jekyll-spaceship', group: :jekyll_plugins

# Add plugin in _config.yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-spaceship
```

It doesn't require the .html file attached with the Mathjax code.

```html
<!--
Add the math js script to the .html file.
It performs the equation rendering.

The markdown equation block is:

$$ \tag{1.1} e^{j \pi} + 1 = 0 $$
-->

<script src=" https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.min.js "></script>
```

### Navigation bar

The navigation bar is the top bar for user experience improvements.
I linked the buttons to the pages with functions, they are .md files inside [\_posts/tool page]().
Their layout is set to the type:

```yml
# Layout setup for navigation linked pages

# Searching page
layout: search
title: Search page
permalink: /search/
excerpt: Built-in page for searching.

# Sorting by categories page
layout: categories
title: Sorted by Categories
permalink: /categories/
excerpt: Built-in page for categories view.
```

## Jekyll spaceship

The plugin is amazing, but it seems conflicting with other settings.

## Github page compatible

The github page needs `remote_theme` rather than `theme` to compile the website.
Remember to change it before push to github.

```yml
# ! The Local and Github settings conflict with each other.
# Local
# theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll
# Github
remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"
```

The [.github/workflows/jekyll.yml]() is added to make the github-pages compile the project.
It also requires the Gemfile in the `root` path of the project, so I copy it.
Moreover, it is needed to reminder that perhaps I have made a mistake to open the access permission too much.
